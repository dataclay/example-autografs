1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,272
Templater can rent a

2
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:02,545
license from a pool

3
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:03,818
of licenses managed by

4
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:05,090
the server software that

5
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,363
you install, set up,

6
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,000
and activate.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,600
When After Effects exits,

8
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
the Templater license is

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
released and returned to

10
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
the license pool.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,391
If the computer running

12
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,782
After Effects is no

13
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,173
longer available, the server

14
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,565
software will release the

15
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:19,956
license after a user-specified

16
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:21,000
time has elapsed.

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,777
The server installation files

18
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:24,555
come with Templater's installation

19
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:25,000
files.

20
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,428
You will also need

21
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:27,857
to connect the computer's

22
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,285
running Templater to the

23
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,000
license server.
