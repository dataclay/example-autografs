1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
The Templater Bot comes

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,500
with a feature that

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,250
makes Templater behave like

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,000
an After Effects-enabled bot.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,846
This feature runs in

6
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,692
the background, observing incoming

7
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,538
data and rendering new

8
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,000
video.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,391
Once your AE project

10
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,782
is ready for use

11
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,173
with Templater, you can

12
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,565
use bot to customize

13
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:19,956
and render it without

14
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:21,000
After Effects UI.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Rendering occurs automatically when

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
new data is transferred

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to the data source.

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,777
Developers can create front-end

19
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,555
applications, such as web

20
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,333
or mobile apps, that

21
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,111
feed data into the

22
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:35,888
Templater data feed, offering

23
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:37,666
a common, custom video

24
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,000
content creation solution.
