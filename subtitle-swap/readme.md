## Usage

`SRT` subtitle files will need to be renamed with a `JSX` extension for this technique to work. This is because After Effects does not have a native file handler to import SRT files. This subtitle data is swapped into a layer, as footage, on the After Effects Timeline. The SRT/JSX file data is parsed by the expression on the designated text layer. 

Templater data is in `Subtitle Swap Data.json`.
