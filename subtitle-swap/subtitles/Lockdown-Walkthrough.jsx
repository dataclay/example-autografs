1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:01,733
In this tool kit.

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:05,533
We have four shots and we can change the
logo on each of them to whatever we want.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,400
We can also change the shirt color

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,700
and the background color

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,233
to track the shot,
go to effect > Vranos > Lockdown,

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,033
then press pop out and track the points
roughly

7
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:23,500
where the logo is going to be placed,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,433
then create some expansion points

9
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,766
and enable interpolation
so they follow the existing points

10
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,833
after you close Lockdown.

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,300
Press the Lockdown button
in the After Effects interface

12
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,900
and it will create a stabilized
pre comp inside here.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,166
Add your logo

14
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,933
back in the main composition.

15
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,800
Your logo will track to the shirt.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,700
There are a lot of fine
points to tracking,

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,833
but these basic steps
will get you most of the way.
