1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:00,566
All right.

2
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:04,533
We've all had that client that needs like
100 different versions of that

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,633
awesome product video that you made,
and they need it right away.

4
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,566
They've got like 100 different T-shirt
designs that they want to showcase.

5
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:11,033
And you're left

6
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:14,600
with figuring out a workflow to produce
all of these on time and on budget.

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:18,433
The solution involves using After Effects
together with image tracking

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,233
and automation.
So Chris is going to show us Lockdown,

9
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,133
which is an image tracking
software for AE.

10
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:27,000
And I'm going to show you Templater,
which is an automation extension for AE.
